# JavaFX-Server-Integrated-WordFilter-UMCS-Exam-2022

This Java project is a real-time word logging and filtering application. Its main features include:

- Real-Time Word Logging: The application connects to a server to receive and log incoming words with timestamps. The word list is sorted alphabetically.

- Real-Time Filtering: The application allows users to filter words based on a text input field. When the user types into the input field, the word list updates in real-time to display only the words that match the filter criteria

- Dynamic Word Count: The application dynamically updates and displays the total count of words that match the filter criteria, providing instant feedback to users.

- Multi-Threaded Network Connection: The application connects to a server in a separate thread, allowing it to receive and display words from a remote source while remaining responsive.
